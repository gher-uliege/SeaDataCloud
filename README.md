## Re-gridding

Re-gridding is the action of interpolation a field from a grid to another grid, usually with a higher resolution.     
[nco](http://nco.sourceforge.net) provides a tool [`ncremap`](http://nco.sourceforge.net/nco.html#ncremap) for this purpose. 

### Installation

1. Download and compile [ESMF](https://earthsystemmodeling.org/download/)
2. Download a recent version of nco.

### Usage

```bash
ncremap -i data.nc -d grid.nc -o data_regridded.nc
```
where:
- *data.nc* is the original file containing the fields,
- *grid.nc* is another file containing the new grid
- *data_regridded.nc* is the final output file with the fields interpolated onto the new grid.

The grid file looks like:
```
dimensions:
	longitude = 851 ;
	latitude = 321 ;
variables:
	float longitude(longitude) ;
		longitude:units = "degrees east" ;
	float latitude(latitude) ;
		latitude:units = "degrees north" ;
}
```

Note that the input file needs to have lon and lat as coordinates. If that's not te case, one can always use [`ncrename`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ncrename), for instance:
```bash
ncrename -d x,lon -v x,lon in.nc
```
* the dimension *x* is renamed *lon*
* the variable *x* is renamed *lon*

### Troubleshooting

#### NetCDF 

If you get errors related to netCDF, define the environment variables as in:

#### Grid file

It seems that the dimensions should be named *longitude* and *latitude*, otherwise the result is strange.
